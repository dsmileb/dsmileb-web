  <h2>Cybersecurity란 무엇인가</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-82/rev-3/draft" target="_blank" title="Opreational Technology">Operational technology</a> <u>(OT)</u></strong> encompasses a broad range of programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems/devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.</p><img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><p style="margin-top:45px;">Cybersecurity risk management is an important factor to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of the goods and services provided and supported by OT. The NIST OT Security Program includes multiple collaborative projects from across the NIST Information Technology Laboratory and Communications Technology Laboratory.</p>
